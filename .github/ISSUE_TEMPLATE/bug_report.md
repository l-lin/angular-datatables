# :beetle: bug report

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## :microscope: Minimal Reproduction

<!-- 
Do not add source code here. The chances of fixing the issue would be higher if you provide a small, reproducible repo to investigate. 
This is because, your source code will not include all the necessary bits that reproduce the issue. For example, you may have included source code for the Angular component that's causing the problem however you might have left out it's background Angular service which fetches/processes relevant data for the table OR your source code doesn't contain the JSON response object DataTables receives from your server which would mean we're missing context here.

Please create and share minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template: https://stackblitz.com/fork/angular-datatables-gitter

If StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue, please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue.
A good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via `ng new repro-app` and add the minimum possible code to show the problem.
Share the link to the repo below along with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem, as well as expected and actual behavior.

Issues that don't have enough info and can't be reproduced WILL be closed.
